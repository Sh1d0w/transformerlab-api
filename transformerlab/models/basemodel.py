class BaseModel:
    """
    A basic representation of a Model in Transformer Lab.

    To add a new model source, create a subclass.
    The key function to override in your subclass is get_model_path,
    and possibly install if there is custom install actions.
    Then in your subclass' constructor call super and then set any additional
    fields you want to store in the model's JSON.

    Properties:
    id:             Unique Transformer Lab model identifier
    name:           Printable name for the model (how it appears in the app)
    status:         A text string that is either "OK" or contains and error message
    json_data:      an unstructured data blob that can contain any data relevant
                    to the model or its model_source.

    JSON FIELDS:
    While the json_data blob is completely flexible, there are certain fields
    that are expected to be present on functioning models including:

    source:         Where the model is stored ("huggingface", "local", etc.)
    source_id_or_path:
                    The id of this model in it source (or path for local files)
    model_filename: With source_id_or_path, a specific filename for this model.
                    For example, GGUF repos have several files representing
                    different versions of teh model.
    architecture:   A string describing the model architecture used to determine
                    support for the model and how to run
    formats:        A array of strings describing the file format used to store model
                    weights. This can be "safetensors", "bin", "gguf", "mlx".

        That is, model sources (hard drive folders, application caches, web sites, etc.)
        will have subclasses of this BaseModel and may use the same id, but their unique_id
        must be unique to Transformer Lab in order to import into the Transfoerm Lab store.
